The high level of customization available for pages and database views, coupled with a clean, distraction-free interface, enhances my experience significantly. The use of templates is a huge time saver, especially for managing projects, planning content, and tracking habits. Linking pages and databases is intuitive and ensures information is easily accessible. Notion\u2019s ability to replace multiple apps like documents, spreadsheets, task managers, and note-taking applications into a single workspace helps me stay organized and reduces the clutter, allowing me to maintain everything cohesively without the hassle of switching between different apps. I find Notion can be overwhelming at first due to its many features. The application can become slow, especially when handling heavy pages on large databases. I also see room for improvement in the offline mode as not everything syncs properly, which affects usability.

It's not just a note app; it's the one central place where I can also organise and develop from initial client brainstorms to final portfolio showcases.It seriously cuts down on bouncing between different apps and makes managing my creative workflow seamless. While the core product is outstanding, its offline capabilities continue to be a significant drawback. Whenever I experience weak Wi-Fi or am traveling, trying to access or update important information becomes extremely slow or sometimes not possible at all. Unified Workspace That Adapts to Your Workflow"}

It supports flexible structuring of information, so I can design pages that match the way I think rather than conforming to a fixed template. The database features are particularly useful because they allow sorting, filtering, and linking across projects, which helps maintain consistency and reduces redundant work. The main limitation is performance when working with large databases or nested pages. Pages can load slowly, which disrupts workflow. Absolutely Love this Product"}
{"id": "real_00004", "rating": 5, "text": "Notion is an all-in-one tool for my life. It helps me plan my highly stressful days as a project manager at a start up. I can put all my personal and work task in a customizable and flexible format which works great for someone who is looking for neurodiversity. It has a fun UI that makes me look forward to making updates and gives me a dopamine rush because I can get everything out of my head in a satisfying way due to how user friendly it is. It\u2019s one of the few I can actually stick with and use daily because my brain relates to ut better than a notepad or Microsoft\u2019s task lists/one note. It the formatting of watch tab is easy to use and fits my work and life in general. Best part is there is a freemium version.

{"id": "real_00005", "rating": 5, "text": "I like the fact that Notion feels quite simple to use, making it approachable even though it has a lot of complex capabilities under the hood. I appreciate how it allows me to set up automations and formulas that link with every form, providing a malleable system that adapts to my needs. This functionality is particularly handy as it helps me manage and link different projects together efficiently, especially when dealing with time constraints. The ability to set urgencies between projects and have everything come to a main dashboard and database is really valuable. It helps me accumulate a structured task plan for the day and ensures that if I've missed something, it flags it for me. This blend of simplicity and powerful automation makes Notion an impressive tool for organizing my business projects. I think there needs to be a simpler method into how one can set up these types of automations and formulas in Notion. While there is a lot of AI usage now, and I know there's a lot it can do, it would be much more helpful if there were templated examples of things it could do instead of having to let the user guess. Additionally, the initial setup was quite hard, as I didn't understand what I was doing or how to do it, so I had to use ChatGPT to guide me. Effortless Daily Planning and Productivity with Notion"}

Additionally, I appreciate that the databases, templates, and the ability to establish relationships between pages work well, allowing me to structure my information efficiently. I also love the distraction-free writing option, which helps me concentrate better.

{"id": "real_00008", "rating": 4, "text": "I use Notion mainly for managing a knowledge database and have recently started using it for task management as well. I love how Notion is built like a brain, or at least like my brain, which makes organizing information intuitive and personalized. The high rotation of employees in my organization is a challenge, but the knowledge database feature ensures continuity and consistency over time. I also appreciate the availability of keyboard shortcuts, which streamline my workflow and make navigation quick and efficient. Additionally, I'm thrilled that Notion provides form services, which were a major reason for switching from Tally forms. I find the desktop app to be quite slow on my computer, which has low RAM, causing performance issues. I also dislike that the full width view is not the default setting for pages, and there is no option to set it as the default for the entire organization, hindering customization. The learning curve is steep, and I'd appreciate a more user-friendly experience for first-time users, specifically by allowing shared default settings for an entire workspace. Additionally, I find that the image preview functionality is inadequate, as it takes a considerable amount of time for images to load. Moreover, the integrations appear nebulous and are challenging to utilize effectively. Intuitive and Customizable Interface That Keeps Us Organized"}

While it is a interactive interface I do with there were more way to discuss with my team members of in a direct way.

{"id": "real_00014", "rating": 5, "text": "What really convinces me about Slack is how it brings together documentation and workflows through its ecosystem of bots and applications. We use Slack for much more than just chatting; it also allows us to interact directly with our knowledge base, such as Confluence or Notion. For example, we can use commands like /search-kb [term] right within a channel to find answers, eliminating the need to switch between different applications. This functionality, along with custom bots that handle simple tasks like launching quick polls or setting reminders, turns Slack into a centralized command hub for our company's information infrastructure. The primary challenge we encounter is managing internal automation workflows using Workflow Builder. Although the tool offers robust capabilities, its interface for constructing complex logic can be less intuitive and more restrictive than we would prefer. This often leads us to rely on code-based solutions for more sophisticated integrations. Additionally, the Canvases feature\u2014persistent documents within Slack\u2014is still developing and does not yet fully substitute for a dedicated documentation tool. As a result, we sometimes end up duplicating important information across different platforms. Slack Keeps My Team Connected and Productive"}

Integrations with other tools also make daily work much easier. Sometimes, the number of messages can be overwhelming and it's easy to overlook something important. When there are too many channels and notifications without proper configuration, everything turns into noise.

It\u2019s super user-friendly, and the notifications let me stay on top of important messages without feeling overwhelmed. Overall, it just makes team communication smoother and more efficient. One thing I don\u2019t like about Slack is how easily it can become overwhelming. With constant notifications, threads, and messages coming in from different channels, it can sometimes feel like a lot to keep up with, especially if you\u2019re in a lot of active channels. It can get a bit chaotic, and if you're not careful with your notification settings, you might miss important messages or get distracted by too many minor updates. Also, while Slack is great for real-time communication, it can sometimes be hard to track long-term discussions or decisions, since threads can get buried in the flood of messages. Lastly, the integrations with other tools are helpful, but they can also add complexity, and sometimes those apps don\u2019t work as smoothly as you\u2019d like.

You can design your own workflows, create custom issue types, and adapt Jira to match the team's style instead of forcing everyone into a fixed structure. Integrations are solid as well... IT connects smoothly with slick, github, Bitbucket, confluence and even design tools. I personally didn't integrated it with other software but the dev team and managing team had experience and they they have good feedback about it. Getting started was easier than expected, with ready-made project templates and guided setup our team and running quickly. The documentation and community support are impressive. Even when we had questions about workflow or automations, we found answers almost immediately. We used Jira almost daily.... from backlog grooming and sprint planning to tracking bugs and releases.

Being able to have unlimited issues and projects ensures that I do not face any problems of reaching the limit and it has also been able to keep everything- small to long-term work- in a single location. I also heavily use the backlog and board views to plan my week and the timeline and calendar views have served me to plot deadlines without forgetting anything. This is likely to be the most beneficial aspect of the forms feature since I am able to gather the information about other teams without sending several messages. The establishment was not complex as well, the project templates and the customization of workflow saved my time a lot. I am now using Jira on a daily basis and when I became comfortable with the layout it was easy to navigate. It has also helped when it has been incorporated with Microsoft Teams, as updates and notifications are displayed where we communicate as a team, so nothing goes astray. I have already contacted the customer care a few times and they were able to respond quickly.

I do not like the new licencing model, it has created another level of administration and fear of breaching member accounts.

I really like the tick boxes - something soo simple, but makes a bit difference. I like the little details like the dates function - It's just a lot more modern than our excel sheet. Some Excel keyboard shortcuts don\u2019t always work \u2014 for example, Ctrl+D (which should fill down like in Excel) often doesn\u2019t do anything. Unmatched Flexibility Lets Every Team Work Their Way"}
{"id": "real_00043", "rating": 4, "text": "What we\u2019ve come to appreciate most about Smartsheet is how flexible it is. Unlike traditional project management software that locks you into one rigid format, Smartsheet gives you the freedom to design your own workflows \u2014 whether that\u2019s through grids, Gantt charts, calendars, or dashboards. For ISDM, this flexibility means that each team can adapt Smartsheet to its own needs while still maintaining a shared language of progress and accountability. For instance, our academic team uses it to plan program calendars and track course deliveries, while our communications team uses it to manage campaigns, content pipelines, and deadlines. it can sometimes feel complex for new users. The learning curve can be steep for team members who aren\u2019t used to project management systems or formula-driven sheets. We\u2019ve found that onboarding and consistent training are key to getting everyone comfortable. Similarly, as our use of Smartsheet has expanded, licensing costs have become something to watch \u2014 the platform is worth the investment, but it\u2019s not cheap if you want advanced features for every team member.

However, for complete mastery, it's necessary to watch some training videos. I should note that I did not participate in the implementation or integration of the solution.

Even though I\u2019m not PMP-certified, I find it very easy to build, track, and manage complex projects. The platform allows me to visualize timelines, assign responsibilities, and follow progress without needing deep technical or project management expertise. It truly simplifies project coordination and keeps everything organized in one place. The navigation within columns can sometimes be distracting compared to Excel. Whenever I need to check specific details or analyze data more closely, I often end up exporting the sheet to Excel to do it there.

This functionality helps me keep my projects on track and minimizes mistakes or the confusion that can come from too many people being involved. I find it challenging to adjust the size of rows and columns, and I wish there were an option to do so more easily. Additionally, starting a new sheet from a blank template is not very straightforward for me. I find it much simpler to create a new sheet by duplicating an existing Smartsheet. Great for Basic Use, Needs Excel-Like Shortcuts"}
{"id": "real_00050", "rating": 4, "text": "I appreciate that Smartsheet acts as a dynamic, updated online tool that avoids the need to resend Excel files after every update. I love how it maintains some of the keyboard shortcuts from Excel, making certain tasks intuitive. I find the reminder feature invaluable for managing long-term tasks, sending me email alerts when needed. Adding notes to lines is intuitive, allowing multiple collaborators to update with timestamps, enhancing teamwork. The affordability and utility of basic features are ideal for our small sales team, making it a practical choice. I find it challenging that Smartsheet's keyboard shortcuts differ from Microsoft Excel, particularly with basic functions like copying and pasting. This inconsistency can be frustrating, especially since I'm used to Excel's interface. Additionally, the limitation on copying and pasting only 500 rows at a time is problematic for my work, especially after an acquisition that increased the number of parts we manage. Also, the control functions for actions like cut and paste aren't always aligned with Excel, which complicates my workflow since I frequently use these features.

Furthermore, the initial setup of monday Work Management was very easy due to its intuitive nature and the availability of numerous helpful tutorial videos. Additionally, compared to our previous tool, Jira, monday Work Management is far more user-friendly and accessible to all user groups, not just developers.

Gantt and calendar views with eye catching and flexible features make visualizing projects and jobs-to-be done easy and attractive. It's minor, but having word processing options within make it really easy to set up a workspace that contains both list/chart views and note/long-form text views in one space. Many ways to work to fit any team or team members preferences, all easily integrated in one space. Admin team and user management is also very intuitive. There's nothing to straight out dislike, but in terms of suggestions, it would ben nice if a gantt chart or calendar view could be built first and have the board prepopulate rather than other way around. Additional flexibility in those features would help as well (ways of viewing, zooming in/out etc.). The way folders work could be improved as well to help with board/file management - for example, right now if you move an item from one folder to another you expand all folders at once and have to re-collapse them all - little things like that.

The ready-to-use templates are a significant asset, thoughtfully designed to meet our needs and significantly reduce the time required to set up new boards for tracking student enrollment and various projects.

Moreover, I like the feature that allows us to leave comments and updates, which keeps everyone aware of what's going on. This transparency and communication help streamline project management and ensure that no important details are missed. I think it would be better if monday Work Management had a more robust system for notifications. The current notification system can be quite weak, especially when connecting with Microsoft Teams.

This organized approach streamlines our workflow and helps maintain consistency across our global operations. I feel that 'monday Work Management' can be difficult to understand and utilize to its full potential. This is mainly due to the challenge our team faces in comprehending the solution and features entirely. Although I appreciate the availability of webinars, more guidance would be helpful.

It\u2019s actually quite a great feature, making the tool very practical and effective for task management across different business types. I find the limited use and implementation of the AI functions in monday Work Management notable. It seems that there is much room for improvement in effectively leveraging AI to create and manage tasks more efficiently.

And the integrations with tools I already use reduced friction in our dev + blogging + team communications workflow.

The transition to ClickUp from Trello and Google Tasks made my life much easier, as it centralizes everything on a single platform, from task management to document and spreadsheet organization. The initial setup process was facilitated by resources like YouTube videos and the official blog, but the support I received when I migrated to the paid plan was incredible, offering video conferences and tips, which further improved my usability on the platform.

I can effortlessly turn emails or chats into tasks instantly, helping me stay on top of projects without the hassle of constantly switching between applications. Additionally, Wrike's AI feature was a crucial reason for our switch from Teamwork, showcasing its ability to innovate and stay ahead. The competitive pricing and outstanding support team further add to the experience, making Wrike a compelling choice for our project management needs. I find the mobile app to have limitations compared to the desktop version. It's useful for quick updates but is less intuitive and lacks some functionalities.

Over time it feels like it we designed it ourselves. The customer care team was helpful when we were starting out. I feel it is not for people who are new to project management tools. It might feel overwhelming if you join an ongoing project setup by others. It will take time to learn and get used. I also feel all the team members have the power to mess the workflow. Wrike - The Best Project Management Tool"}

It simplifies project management and makes progress tracking effortless. A key benefit is the ability to assign tasks to specific users and monitor their status within a single platform. Wrike enhances workflow efficiency while delivering accurate, high-quality data. It\u2019s user-friendly, and the online support team is consistently helpful and reliable. Honestly, there's nothing I don't like about Wrike. A great tool for management and organization across all project sizes"}
{"id": "real_00088", "rating": 5, "text": "What I like the most about Write is the high level of customization it offers for each project. You can easily set the level of communication and collaboration with co-workers or team members, which makes it adaptable for small, medium, and large projects. The user interface is smooth, clear, and very intuitive. It\u2019s also easy to use, and customer support is responsive and helpful. I especially value the built-in features like project risk tracking, Gantt charts that automatically update tasks, and the ability to assign specific tasks to the right people. The recent addition of AI capabilities makes the tool even more powerful and forward-looking. Because there are so many features and options available, it can feel overwhelming at first. For new users, a simpler starting view or setup could make the onboarding process easier. Once you get familiar with the platform, however, it becomes much easier to navigate and take advantage of all the features. Wrike: Easy to Use, Excellent Support, Best Management Platform"}
{"id": "real_00089", "rating": 4, "text": "Currently, Wrike is the best Management platform in the market. Its super easy to use, lots of online support and help is available and its easy to implement in work place. Pricing options and safety features are still concerning. My organization still doubts about complete functionality A great tool to organize your Tasks and Projects every day"}
{"id": "real_00090", "rating": 5, "text": "Wrike has been a key tool in organizing my individual work and coordinating with my team. I use it in my daily routine, and it has become a fundamental part of my work routine. What I highlight the most is its intuitive interface, which allows for quick adaptation without the need for an extensive learning curve. From the first use, managing tasks, projects, and assignments becomes very smooth. Although in general I find Wrike to be an excellent tool, there are some details that could be improved to make the experience even smoother. One of the aspects that complicates things for me the most is when I change a task's status within the workflow. Sometimes, after dragging a task to a new column (for example, from \"In Progress\" to \"Completed\"), I can't immediately see it in its new status. This creates some uncertainty, as it makes me doubt whether the change was really saved or if the task ended up in the right place."}
