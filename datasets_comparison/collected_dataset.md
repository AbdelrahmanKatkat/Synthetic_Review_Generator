4.5/5
What do you like best about Notion?
I love how Notion allows me to manage my notes, daily tasks, projects, and personal documentation all in one place. It serves as my hub for planning, writing, storing resources, and collaborating on short-term projects, making it an indispensable knowledge base. The high level of customization available for pages and database views, coupled with a clean, distraction-free interface, enhances my experience significantly. The use of templates is a huge time saver, especially for managing projects, planning content, and tracking habits. Linking pages and databases is intuitive and ensures information is easily accessible. Notion’s ability to replace multiple apps like documents, spreadsheets, task managers, and note-taking applications into a single workspace helps me stay organized and reduces the clutter, allowing me to maintain everything cohesively without the hassle of switching between different apps.
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What do you dislike about Notion?
I find Notion can be overwhelming at first due to its many features. The application can become slow, especially when handling heavy pages on large databases. I also see room for improvement in the offline mode as not everything syncs properly, which affects usability. Formatting on the mobile version is more challenging compared to the desktop version, and the reminders and basic functionality feel quite limited compared to dedicated tools for those tasks.

"Excellent All-in-One productive space for Project & Design Work"
4/5
What do you like best about Notion?
What I absolutely love about Notion is how ridiculously flexible it is. It's not just a note app; it's the one central place where I can also organise and develop from initial client brainstorms to final portfolio showcases.It seriously cuts down on bouncing between different apps and makes managing my creative workflow seamless.
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What do you dislike about Notion?
While the core product is outstanding, its offline capabilities continue to be a significant drawback. Whenever I experience weak Wi-Fi or am traveling, trying to access or update important information becomes extremely slow or sometimes not possible at all.

"Unified Workspace That Adapts to Your Workflow"
5/5
What do you like best about Notion?
I find Notion most valuable for its unified workspace that integrates documents, databases, and task management in one environment. It supports flexible structuring of information, so I can design pages that match the way I think rather than conforming to a fixed template. The database features are particularly useful because they allow sorting, filtering, and linking across projects, which helps maintain consistency and reduces redundant work.
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What do you dislike about Notion?
The main limitation is performance when working with large databases or nested pages. Pages can load slowly, which disrupts workflow.

"Absolutely Love this Product"
5/5
What do you like best about Notion?
Notion is an all-in-one tool for my life. It helps me plan my highly stressful days as a project manager at a start up. I can put all my personal and work task in a customizable and flexible format which works great for someone who is looking for neurodiversity. It has a fun UI that makes me look forward to making updates and gives me a dopamine rush because I can get everything out of my head in a satisfying way due to how user friendly it is. It’s one of the few I can actually stick with and use daily because my brain relates to ut better than a notepad or Microsoft’s task lists/one note. It the formatting of watch tab is easy to use and fits my work and life in general. Best part is there is a freemium version.
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What do you dislike about Notion?
I wish they had a tab for a concept board where I can scribble down things and drop sticky notes beside it. In almost every area I love this tool otherwise.

"Powerful Yet Complex - Amazing Features"
5/5
What do you like best about Notion?
I like the fact that Notion feels quite simple to use, making it approachable even though it has a lot of complex capabilities under the hood. I appreciate how it allows me to set up automations and formulas that link with every form, providing a malleable system that adapts to my needs. This functionality is particularly handy as it helps me manage and link different projects together efficiently, especially when dealing with time constraints. The ability to set urgencies between projects and have everything come to a main dashboard and database is really valuable. It helps me accumulate a structured task plan for the day and ensures that if I've missed something, it flags it for me. This blend of simplicity and powerful automation makes Notion an impressive tool for organizing my business projects.
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What do you dislike about Notion?
I think there needs to be a simpler method into how one can set up these types of automations and formulas in Notion. While there is a lot of AI usage now, and I know there's a lot it can do, it would be much more helpful if there were templated examples of things it could do instead of having to let the user guess. Additionally, the initial setup was quite hard, as I didn't understand what I was doing or how to do it, so I had to use ChatGPT to guide me.

"Effortless Daily Planning and Productivity with Notion"
4.5/5
What do you like best about Notion?
Notion is the software that help us in planning our day much efficiently as it has different type of to-do lists, notes google docs, excel sheets etc where all the entries and data input can be noted down and executed according to priority. Notion helps us in utilising our daily working hour in a much better way
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What do you dislike about Notion?
When I installed notion for the first time I got confused because the software has too many planning features and tools for maintaining day to day tasks. I would recommend to team notion that they should also provide a training session for their new users who subscribe to their platform for business purposes.

"Centralize and Improve Information Management"
4.5/5
What do you like best about Notion?
I enjoy having everything in one place with Notion, which allows me to start with something very simple, like a text page, and then enhance it by adding tables, tasks, tags, and creating relationships between pages, as well as calendar and board views. This offers me a personalized way to organize my work. Additionally, I appreciate that the databases, templates, and the ability to establish relationships between pages work well, allowing me to structure my information efficiently. I also love the distraction-free writing option, which helps me concentrate better.
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What do you dislike about Notion?
I would say it could be the performance with many pages or databases, learning curve, mobile use, too much flexibility.

"Versatile and Intuitive, Yet Room for UX Improvements"
4.5/5
What do you like best about Notion?
I use Notion mainly for managing a knowledge database and have recently started using it for task management as well. I love how Notion is built like a brain, or at least like my brain, which makes organizing information intuitive and personalized. The high rotation of employees in my organization is a challenge, but the knowledge database feature ensures continuity and consistency over time. I also appreciate the availability of keyboard shortcuts, which streamline my workflow and make navigation quick and efficient. Additionally, I'm thrilled that Notion provides form services, which were a major reason for switching from Tally forms.
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What do you dislike about Notion?
I find the desktop app to be quite slow on my computer, which has low RAM, causing performance issues. I also dislike that the full width view is not the default setting for pages, and there is no option to set it as the default for the entire organization, hindering customization. The learning curve is steep, and I'd appreciate a more user-friendly experience for first-time users, specifically by allowing shared default settings for an entire workspace. Additionally, I find that the image preview functionality is inadequate, as it takes a considerable amount of time for images to load. Moreover, the integrations appear nebulous and are challenging to utilize effectively.

"Intuitive and Customizable Interface That Keeps Us Organized"
5/5
What do you like best about Notion?
The user interface. It’s easy to customize and organize. I’ve always had issues with other programs having a layout where either I get confused or I can’t find things, notion is clear and easy to read thus I can quickly understand what me and my team need to do.
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What do you dislike about Notion?
While it is a interactive interface I do with there were more way to discuss with my team members of in a direct way. It is still easy to message but it would be cool if there could be come integrations with services like zoom where we could a schedule meetings and have them through the website itself, really keeping everything within one contained area.

5/5
What do you like best about Notion?
The embedding and linking features are outstanding: it's easy to link one page to another, drag and drop blocks, and create either a wiki or a task board with the same level of simplicity. This flexibility allows me to move seamlessly from brainstorming ideas to executing tasks, all within a single app. What I appreciate most is how the tool adapts to my needs, rather than forcing me to adapt to it. I can organize pages, databases, and links however I like

've set up a system where my blog ideas, app tasks, and personal notes all coexist in one place.
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What do you dislike about Notion?
Offline access works, but not as seamlessly as a native desktop app. Also, because the system is so flexible, different teams sometimes build pages in completely different styles unless we set a few internal guidelines.

What do you like best about Slack?
Very easy to use and stay connected with my team, even when working remote. I love that there is a mobile app to use on the go.

The messages have options to mark them as unread, or to set a reminder for a later time so that Slack can remind you to address a message.

I also love that we can send gifs and set statuses. Statuses can link up to google calendar so it'll show you're in a meeting and unavailable when you have an event.

"Slack: The Ultimate Hub for Seamless Team Collaboration and Integration"
5/5
What do you like best about Slack?
I'd like to acknowledge the crucial role that Slack plays in our daily staff operations. Slack is the undisputed champion of real-time team communication and has transformed how our internal teams execute work.


For high-velocity, day-to-day collaboration, Slack provides the instantaneity and responsiveness needed at an organization like ours. Its channel-based organization keeps communication segmented by topic and team, replacing internal email entirely for quick queries, status updates, and rapid problem-solving.


A major advantage for our staff is Slack’s robust integration ecosystem. Our favorite automations include:


GitHub: Instantly notifies engineering channels about new pull requests, code merges, and issue updates, keeping development cycles moving without context switching.


CultureAmp: Connects our employee experience platform directly to our People channels, allowing us to deliver pulse check surveys and share anonymized feedback summaries seamlessly.


Donut: Crucial for building remote culture, Donut pairs up random team members for coffee chats, fostering cross-functional relationships and breaking down silos.
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What do you dislike about Slack?
The primary drawback of using Slack, which is widely cited and contrasts directly with its strength of "instantaneity," is notification overload and distraction, which can severely hurt employee productivity and focus.

Everything is organised, searchable and easy to track.

What do you dislike about Slack?
The biggest thing that I dislike is the thread conversation/UI is not good, it is prone to miss out very easily.


Also, if you have multiple workspace the web - app does not support a view where I can view all of it.


I have to keep switching and see if I have any notification in the other workspace!


We had a paid plan but have now gone to a free one during this year, the other thing I don't like is that the post beyond 90 days are locked.

"Slack: The Ultimate Hub for Seamless Workflows and Knowledge Integration"
5/5
What do you like best about Slack?
What really convinces me about Slack is how it brings together documentation and workflows through its ecosystem of bots and applications. We use Slack for much more than just chatting; it also allows us to interact directly with our knowledge base, such as Confluence or Notion. For example, we can use commands like /search-kb [term] right within a channel to find answers, eliminating the need to switch between different applications. This functionality, along with custom bots that handle simple tasks like launching quick polls or setting reminders, turns Slack into a centralized command hub for our company's information infrastructure.
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What do you dislike about Slack?
The primary challenge we encounter is managing internal automation workflows using Workflow Builder. Although the tool offers robust capabilities, its interface for constructing complex logic can be less intuitive and more restrictive than we would prefer. This often leads us to rely on code-based solutions for more sophisticated integrations. Additionally, the Canvases feature—persistent documents within Slack—is still developing and does not yet fully substitute for a dedicated documentation tool. As a result, we sometimes end up duplicating important information across different platforms.

Slack makes communication fast, organized, and easy to manage. I like how channels keep conversations focused, and the search function makes it simple to find past messages, files, and updates.

What do you dislike about Slack?
The only downside is that Slack can get noisy when there are many channels and notifications. Messages can move quickly, and it’s easy to miss updates if you’re away for a short time. I’d also love more intelligent filtering or prioritization features to highlight the most important conversations.

"Centralized and Agile Communication for Teams"
4.5/5
What do you like best about Slack?
I like that I can centralize all team communication in one place, keeping everything organized by channels. Channels and direct messages are very useful because they allow me to separate topics and communicate quickly with whoever I need. This reduces the number of emails and promotes more agile and real-time communication. Additionally, project or team channels help keep conversations organized. Integrations with other tools also make daily work much easier.
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What do you dislike about Slack?
Sometimes, the number of messages can be overwhelming and it's easy to overlook something important. When there are too many channels and notifications without proper configuration, everything turns into noise. Receiving many notifications can be a distraction, and relevant topics can easily get lost among so many conversations. If the team doesn't use the tool in an organized way, it ends up becoming chaotic.

"Streamlining Communication and Boosting Efficiency: A Review of Slack"
5/5
What do you like best about Slack?
What I like best about Slack is how it centralizes communication in a way that keeps everything organized and easy to navigate. It allows teams to communicate in real-time, which is perfect for quick updates and collaboration. I also really appreciate how customizable it is—whether it’s through channels, direct messages, or integrations with other tools like Google Drive or Trello. The ability to have different channels for different projects or topics helps keep conversations focused, and the search feature is great for finding past discussions or files quickly. It’s super user-friendly, and the notifications let me stay on top of important messages without feeling overwhelmed. Overall, it just makes team communication smoother and more efficient.
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What do you dislike about Slack?
One thing I don’t like about Slack is how easily it can become overwhelming. With constant notifications, threads, and messages coming in from different channels, it can sometimes feel like a lot to keep up with, especially if you’re in a lot of active channels. It can get a bit chaotic, and if you're not careful with your notification settings, you might miss important messages or get distracted by too many minor updates. Also, while Slack is great for real-time communication, it can sometimes be hard to track long-term discussions or decisions, since threads can get buried in the flood of messages. Lastly, the integrations with other tools are helpful, but they can also add complexity, and sometimes those apps don’t work as smoothly as you’d like. It would be nice if there were ways to manage these things a bit more effectively.

"Unmatched Customization and Integration Powerhouse"
5/5
What do you like best about Jira?
The strongest advantage of Jira is how customizable and adaptable it is. Teams can modify workflows, screens, fields, and permissions to match exactly how their process works. Scrum teams benefit from its sprint boards, burndown charts, backlog grooming, and story point tracking. The ability to integrate with tools like GitHub, Bitbucket, Slack, Confluence, and CI/CD systems makes Jira a central hub for planning and tracking work from start to finish.

What do you dislike about Jira?
Jira's biggest drawback is its complexity. The interface can be dense, especially for new users who see many menus and configuration options. Setting up workflows, screens, and custom rules might require deep knowledge or admin support. If a workspace has been poorly configured over time, Jira can become cluttered with unnecessary issue types, long forms, and confusing statuses.

"A reliable project management platform that keeps teams organized and on-track."
4.5/5
What do you like best about Jira?
What I like most about Jira is how well it organizes the entire workflow for our team. Tasks, Bugs, sprints, everything stays in one place. The agile boards are extremely easy to follow, and it becomes clear very quickly who is working on what and where the bottlenecks are. The customization options are a big plus. You can design your own workflows, create custom issue types, and adapt Jira to match the team's style instead of forcing everyone into a fixed structure. Integrations are solid as well... IT connects smoothly with slick, github, Bitbucket, confluence and even design tools. I personally didn't integrated it with other software but the dev team and managing team had experience and they they have good feedback about it. Getting started was easier than expected, with ready-made project templates and guided setup our team and running quickly. The documentation and community support are impressive. Even when we had questions about workflow or automations, we found answers almost immediately. We used Jira almost daily.... from backlog grooming and sprint planning to tracking bugs and releases. It has basically become the backbone of our project workflow.
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What do you dislike about Jira?
The interface can feel overwhelming at first, I mean the first time I logged in it does feel like that. It took some time to get accustomed. Even our new team members who are not familiar with agile tools. Some advanced configurations also require more time to understand. Performance can slow down a bit with very large projects.

"Unmatched Flexibility and Customization for Engineering Teams"
5/5
What do you like best about Jira?
Jira's greatest strength is its flexibility and depth. Almost everything from workflows and statuses to issue types and automations can be customized based on a team's process. This level of configurability is extremely valuable for engineering teams with complex deliverables. Its sprint boards are powerful; teams can manage backlogs, estimate tasks, link related tickets, visualize work in progress, and track velocity trends.
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What do you dislike about Jira?
Jira's power can also be its weakness. For new users, the interface is complex and may feel overwhelming. Navigating boards, filters, workflows, and issue properties can be confusing until someone becomes familiar with the system. Highly customized workflows often create friction; too many statuses, transitions, or automation rules can slow down everyday usage.

Jira's strongest advantage is its flexibility. It allows teams to customize workflows, issue types, and boards to match any development or project style.

What do you dislike about Jira?
Because of its advanced features, Jira can feel overwhelming for new users. The interface is sometimes cluttered, and customizing workflows can become complicated without prior experience.

"Jira made managing my tasks and projects much easier."
4/5
What do you like best about Jira?
I now use Jira in my day-to-day activities since the manner of managing issues and projects makes it very convenient to me to be organised. Being able to have unlimited issues and projects ensures that I do not face any problems of reaching the limit and it has also been able to keep everything- small to long-term work- in a single location. I also heavily use the backlog and board views to plan my week and the timeline and calendar views have served me to plot deadlines without forgetting anything. This is likely to be the most beneficial aspect of the forms feature since I am able to gather the information about other teams without sending several messages. The establishment was not complex as well, the project templates and the customization of workflow saved my time a lot. I am now using Jira on a daily basis and when I became comfortable with the layout it was easy to navigate. It has also helped when it has been incorporated with Microsoft Teams, as updates and notifications are displayed where we communicate as a team, so nothing goes astray. I have already contacted the customer care a few times and they were able to respond quickly.
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What do you dislike about Jira?
The primary issue I have discovered with Jira is that initially it may seem somewhat overwhelming because of the available variety of features and views. It requires time to know how all things fit in and new users may end up lost in the menus or settings.

"Empowers Team Collaboration and Project Transparency"
5/5
What do you like best about Jira?
What I appreciate most about Jira is how it brings transparency to the whole development process. I find it especially helpful for team collaboration, tracking progress, and keeping everyone aware of priorities, blockers, and deadlines. The customizable workflows and dashboards also make managing even complex projects much more efficient.
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What do you dislike about Jira?
Jira offers a lot of power, but at times it seems overly complex for straightforward workflows. Navigating between boards, issues, and backlogs can be sluggish or involve more steps than expected. Additionally, when there are numerous fields and custom workflows, the interface tends to become cluttered, which makes it more challenging to maintain a clean and organized workspace.

"From Idea to Deploy: Finally a Workflow That Follows me, Not Vice-Versa"
5/5
What do you like best about Jira?
I like the views flexibility: board view for daily tasks, list view for backlog refinement, timeline view for roadmap planning. Switching feels natural and helps me see tasks from different angles. The scalability is impressive: As my blog, app dev and features workload grew, I didn't feel like I needed to move to a bigger tool - the same Jira instance handled extra epics, teams and integrations without breaking the flow.
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What do you dislike about Jira?
Customising reports and dashboards to match how we measure work (especially outside of standard dev metrics) sometimes required and add-on or extra plugin - so there's extra cost or work if you want deep custom analytics.

"A reliable tool for keeping project organized"
4.5/5
What do you like best about Jira?
I like most about is that once you get the hang of it , it is genuinely easy to use for managing daily task and tracking progress. The implementation is flexible and you can shape to match your teams workflow without too much trouble. I also appreciate the number of features it offers boards, sprint , reports automation there's a tool for almost everything. I use very frequently and it fits in smoothly with other tools so the integrations parts feels natural. Whenever i have needed help their customer support has been responsive and clear.

What do you dislike about Jira?
It can feel overwhelming for new users because of the number of settings and configurations. Some parts of the ui also feel a bit slow when working on projects.



"Effortless Project Organization and Team Collaboration"
5/5
What do you like best about Asana?
I love how easy Asana makes it to organize projects, assign tasks, and keep everyone on the same page. The boards, timelines, and subtasks give me a clear picture of what’s in progress and what’s coming next. It’s especially helpful for managing multiple clients and deadlines at once, and the reminders and notifications make sure nothing slips through the cracks.
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What do you dislike about Asana?
Sometimes Asana can feel a bit overwhelming for new team members because there are so many views and options. A few features are slightly hidden in menus, so it can take a minute to figure out where things are. It would also be nice if reporting and time-tracking were more robust without needing extra integrations. Overall, the benefits still far outweigh these small drawbacks.

"Effortless Organization and Team Coordination"
5/5
What do you like best about Asana?
I really appreciate how user-friendly Asana is. Learning to use it was quick and straightforward, which is a big plus because it saves us from needing any formal training sessions, making the initial setup a breeze. This ease of use is particularly beneficial when onboarding new team members, as they can start using the platform without any hassle—it's truly plug-and-play friendly. I find the quick and easy setup invaluable for my organization, streamlining our processes effectively. On top of that, I think the functionality of Asana is perfect, meeting all my productivity needs flawlessly. My preference for the app over the web version shows just how well the application performs for me. I'm so satisfied with Asana that I would rate my likelihood of recommending it to a friend or colleague a solid 10.

"Easy Integration, But Task Assignment Limits"
4/5
What do you like best about Asana?
I appreciate how Asana's API is more user-friendly with higher rate limits, which significantly enhances my workflow by allowing the uploading of larger batches of data efficiently. The ease of data replication through Asana due to the integration with my replication vendor is a major advantage. I find the initial setup of Asana to be very easy, which helped me transition to using the software with minimal effort and inconvenience. The ability to use Asana in tandem with other tools like Stitchdata and Airflow for data replication and orchestration seamlessly fits into my work processes, making the entire experience smooth and efficient.
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What do you dislike about Asana?
I dislike that Asana does not allow assigning multiple people to tasks, which is a limitation in cases where collaboration from team members across different departments is necessary.

"Essential for Remote Team Collaboration, but Requires Extensive Onboarding"
4.5/5
What do you like best about Asana?
I appreciate how Asana helps keep our team connected, even though we all work remotely for a significant portion of the week. It enables us to communicate in real time as we progress through different projects, making it invaluable for our creative collaboration across all departments in a small nonprofit. I love that Asana makes it very easy for our team to stay focused and connected on complex and lengthy tasks. It's a great platform for direct communication and allows us to champion each other's work as we go through projects together.
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What do you dislike about Asana?
I find the onboarding process for Asana quite challenging, as it takes a significant amount of time and effort to train the entire team, especially given their varying skill sets. It required dedicated team members to focus on this as part of their job for several weeks. While Asana is a robust platform, this complexity in initial training could be a potential concern for new users or teams considering adopting it.

"Efficient Task Management but UI Needs Improvement"
4/5
What do you like best about Asana?
I find Asana to be an excellent project management tool that greatly enhances team collaboration and efficiency. It allows us to create, track, and optimize the workflow of any project with ease. The ability to divide big tasks into smaller, manageable ones is particularly valuable to me, as it helps streamline the process and ensure tasks are completed efficiently. The platform's feature of assigning tasks to specific team members enhances accountability, ensuring that everyone remains on top of their responsibilities. Furthermore, I appreciate the Asana app integrated with Microsoft Teams, as it consolidates all relevant information and notifications into a single platform, making it easier to stay updated. I also found Asana’s instructional system remarkably effective, making the learning process seamless and ensuring a smooth transition for the team when we first started using the tool years ago.

What do you dislike about Asana?
I dislike that the interface could be more friendly, especially regarding color choices, as it might not be visually appealing to all users. Additionally, the location of some buttons can be confusing, which may disrupt the workflow and add unnecessary complexity to navigation.

What do you like best about Asana?
One of the things I like most about Asana is its clean, intuitive interface. It makes project management feel less overwhelming by breaking things down into manageable tasks and sub-tasks. Plus, the ability to customize views (like boards, lists, and timelines) makes it versatile for different workflows.

"Great for Team Organization and Project Tracking"
4.5/5
What do you like best about Asana?
I really like how Asana makes it easy to organize and track projects in one central place. The interface is intuitive, and features like task assignments, due dates, and project timelines help keep everyone accountable and on the same page. The ability to integrate with other tools (like Slack, Google Drive, and Zoom) is also super helpful. Overall, it improves team communication, boosts productivity, and ensures that deadlines don’t slip through the cracks.
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What do you dislike about Asana?
One downside of Asana is that it can feel a bit overwhelming at first, especially for new users who aren’t familiar with project management tools. There are so many features and views that it takes time to learn how to use them effectively. It can also get cluttered if projects aren’t well organized, and some advanced features are only available in paid plans. Additionally, notifications can become excessive if not managed properly, which sometimes makes it harder to focus.

Asana is great for keeping projects organized and tracking team tasks. The interface is clean and intuitive, and the notifications make sure nothing gets forgotten. I really like the subtasks and dependencies feature — it helps a lot with prioritizing and meeting deadlines. The integrations with Google Drive and Slack also make the daily workflow much smoother.
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What do you dislike about Asana?
Sometimes Asana can feel a bit overwhelming when managing multiple large projects at once. There are many features, and it can take time for new users to learn how to use them effectively. Also, the mobile app is less fluid than the desktop version, especially when editing or reorganizing tasks.

5/5
What do you like best about Asana?
I appreciate being able to add my own custom fields and tags, which work well together. It's simple to set up workflows that minimize the need to recreate tasks or manually mark them as 'completed.' The customizable forms are also excellent, making it easy to add new tasks.
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What do you dislike about Asana?
Exporting information from projects can be quite a hassle. I use this tool to keep track of OHS items and meeting minutes, but when I export the data as a CSV file, I still need to manually adjust it to make it more legible.

"Great for Scalability, but Initial Learning Curve for New Users"
4.5/5
What do you like best about Asana?
As a Marketing Manager juggling multiple campaigns, content calendars, and cross-departmental collaborations, Asana has become the central hub that keeps everything on track. After years of using various project management tools, I can confidently say that Asana strikes the ideal balance between structure and flexibility, empowering both strategic planning and daily execution.


Asana’s project templates and timeline views are invaluable for marketing campaigns. I can map out every phase—from creative concepting and content creation to launch and reporting—within a single workspace. Dependencies make it easy to visualize how a single delay affects the overall timeline, ensuring no step is overlooked. The ability to toggle between List, Board, Timeline, and Calendar views allows me to plan strategically while my team manages their individual tasks in whichever format suits them best.


The My Tasks dashboard is my daily command center. It provides a clear breakdown of what's due today, what's upcoming, and what's waiting on others. I love that recurring tasks automatically populate (like weekly reporting or social post scheduling), which keeps routine workflows seamless. Custom fields also help us track campaign stages, asset types, and content approvals—no more guessing where things stand.


What sets Asana apart is how it eliminates endless email threads and chat clutter. Each task becomes its own micro-workspace with assigned owners, subtasks, comments, and attachments. Tagging team members keeps communication contextual, while integrations with tools like Slack, Google Drive, and Adobe Creative Cloud make collaboration effortless. I can review a design, give feedback, and move the task to the next stage all within Asana—no back-and-forth needed.


As a manager, I rely heavily on Dashboards and Reporting to monitor campaign health. The ability to create custom charts showing progress, workload, and deadlines helps me keep leadership informed without manually compiling data. The workload view has also been a game changer for resource allocation—it’s easy to see who’s overloaded and redistribute tasks before burnout sets in.


Asana isn’t just a project management tool—it’s the backbone of my marketing operations. It provides visibility across teams, accountability for every task, and the flexibility to adapt as priorities shift. Whether I’m coordinating a nationwide campaign or managing day-to-day creative requests, Asana ensures nothing falls through the cracks.
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What do you dislike about Asana?
For new users, Asana’s feature set can feel a bit overwhelming. However, once the structure is established, especially with thoughtful naming conventions and templates, it becomes intuitive and highly scalable. The mobile app is excellent for on-the-go updates and quick check-ins during meetings or site visits.







"Intuitive and User-Friendly Platform That Simplifies Planning"
4/5
What do you like best about Smartsheet?
Easy to use, not full of colours and big boxes like other products, you can see your plan on one page. It's intuitive easy for people to understand after just 5 minutes of coaching. Collaborative working works well in the most part with live updates when two people are on the same sheet.
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What do you dislike about Smartsheet?
I do not like the new licencing model, it has created another level of administration and fear of breaching member accounts. What was almost a USP over other products that everyone didn't need to be licenced and a clear direction of where Smartsheet is heading. The whole new licencing model is also not very straight forward.

I think some big improvements are needed on backups, it is not easy to restore and would prefer a more snapshot of time and easier to undo changes that people have made. Importing from excel could be better executed with field pickers for things like dates and multiple worksheet excel documents.

Adding a new user is clunky and doesn't always work, have had to add people twice as the first time didn't work then the endless refreshing of pages to get the change/addition to happen.

Dashboards need to be more powerful and are a bit basic.

"Smartsheet Modernized Our Workflow and Boosted Team Collaboration"
4/5
What do you like best about Smartsheet?
The collaboration within the team has improved significantly. I also find the filters to be very useful. We moved our trackers from Excel to Smartsheet, and it works much better now, even in terms of how it feels to use. I have to say, the forms have made things a lot easier for us. I really like the tick boxes - something soo simple, but makes a bit difference. I like the little details like the dates function - It's just a lot more modern than our excel sheet.
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What do you dislike about Smartsheet?
Some Excel keyboard shortcuts don’t always work — for example, Ctrl+D (which should fill down like in Excel) often doesn’t do anything.


It can feel a bit sluggish when working with larger sheets.


There’s no offline mode, which can sometimes be inconvenient if the internet connection drops.


Finally, when you are working as a team, the updates aren't always immediate, and sometimes have reload the whole tab.

"Unmatched Flexibility Lets Every Team Work Their Way"
4/5
What do you like best about Smartsheet?
What we’ve come to appreciate most about Smartsheet is how flexible it is. Unlike traditional project management software that locks you into one rigid format, Smartsheet gives you the freedom to design your own workflows — whether that’s through grids, Gantt charts, calendars, or dashboards. For ISDM, this flexibility means that each team can adapt Smartsheet to its own needs while still maintaining a shared language of progress and accountability. For instance, our academic team uses it to plan program calendars and track course deliveries, while our communications team uses it to manage campaigns, content pipelines, and deadlines.
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What do you dislike about Smartsheet?
it can sometimes feel complex for new users. The learning curve can be steep for team members who aren’t used to project management systems or formula-driven sheets. We’ve found that onboarding and consistent training are key to getting everyone comfortable. Similarly, as our use of Smartsheet has expanded, licensing costs have become something to watch — the platform is worth the investment, but it’s not cheap if you want advanced features for every team member.

I use this solution several times a week. I particularly appreciate the ability to customize the Gantt view as well as the project view. The additional resource management module is also interesting, although it's unfortunate that you have to pay extra to benefit from it. The basic features are quite easy to grasp. However, for complete mastery, it's necessary to watch some training videos. I should note that I did not participate in the implementation or integration of the solution.

"SmartSheet has become an essential part of my workflow"
4/5
What do you like best about Smartsheet?
I’ve been using SmartSheet for 4–5 years to coordinate projects across multiple departments, and I have to say the experience has been surprisingly positive. It has gone through several upgrades over time. What I like most is the combination of a spreadsheet-style interface and automation features — it’s like using Excel, but with a brain that understands workflow.


The ability to add comments, attach documents, track changes, organise tasks, and send notifications makes collaboration much easier. I especially appreciate that everyone on the team can see real-time progress without the need for endless email threads.


Overall, SmartSheet has become an essential tool for organising work and facilitating communication within the team.
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What do you dislike about Smartsheet?
The interface design could be improved a bit, but that’s mostly a matter of personal preference, so it doesn’t really affect my overall impression or rating of the app.

"Effortless Project Management with Smartsheet’s Intuitive Interface"
5/5
What do you like best about Smartsheet?
What I like best about Smartsheet is its user-friendly interface and intuitive design. Even though I’m not PMP-certified, I find it very easy to build, track, and manage complex projects. The platform allows me to visualize timelines, assign responsibilities, and follow progress without needing deep technical or project management expertise. It truly simplifies project coordination and keeps everything organized in one place.
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What do you dislike about Smartsheet?
The navigation within columns can sometimes be distracting compared to Excel. Whenever I need to check specific details or analyze data more closely, I often end up exporting the sheet to Excel to do it there. Ideally, Smartsheet should allow for a smoother and more flexible in-platform data review experience, so everything can be done directly without the need for exporting.

Smartsheet is straightforward to use and features an intuitive, user-friendly interface.

"Great for Basic Use, Needs Excel-Like Shortcuts"
4/5
What do you like best about Smartsheet?
I appreciate that Smartsheet acts as a dynamic, updated online tool that avoids the need to resend Excel files after every update. I love how it maintains some of the keyboard shortcuts from Excel, making certain tasks intuitive. I find the reminder feature invaluable for managing long-term tasks, sending me email alerts when needed. Adding notes to lines is intuitive, allowing multiple collaborators to update with timestamps, enhancing teamwork. The affordability and utility of basic features are ideal for our small sales team, making it a practical choice.
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What do you dislike about Smartsheet?
I find it challenging that Smartsheet's keyboard shortcuts differ from Microsoft Excel, particularly with basic functions like copying and pasting. This inconsistency can be frustrating, especially since I'm used to Excel's interface. Additionally, the limitation on copying and pasting only 500 rows at a time is problematic for my work, especially after an acquisition that increased the number of parts we manage. Also, the control functions for actions like cut and paste aren't always aligned with Excel, which complicates my workflow since I frequently use these features.

I love the user interface of monday Work Management; it's slick and aesthetically pleasing, making the platform more enjoyable to use. This ease of use significantly reduces the barrier to adoption within my team, driving better engagement because anyone can quickly pick it up and understand how it works. The various filtering options available are incredibly useful, allowing me to organize workspaces in multiple ways to suit different team needs, which is invaluable for efficient 1:1s and team meetings. Furthermore, the initial setup of monday Work Management was very easy due to its intuitive nature and the availability of numerous helpful tutorial videos. Additionally, compared to our previous tool, Jira, monday Work Management is far more user-friendly and accessible to all user groups, not just developers. With the addition of Monday.com Development, the platform now effectively fulfills all our requirements that were previously handled by Jira.

As a developer, I like how easily I can automate integrations using the Monday API, GraphQL, and webhooks. The platform’s structure (boards > groups > items > subitems) makes it intuitive for both technical and non-technical teams.

Centralized dashboards, cross-board automation, and the new Workflows engine significantly reduce manual processes and improve visibility across projects.

What do you dislike about monday Work Management?
Some advanced automations still require custom coding or external services, especially when handling large datasets or complex conditional logic.

API rate limits and occasional column-type inconsistencies can slow down heavy integrations.

Also, performance on very large boards (50k+ items) tends to drop, and certain features—like subitem permissions and formula-automation interactions—still need maturity.

"Versatile, Intuitive, and Essential for Project Management"
5/5
What do you like best about monday Work Management?
I've used Monday for about 8 years now and it's proven to be one of the most useful, versatile, and intuitive tools I use in my day-to-day. Boards are easy to use with powerful customization and workflow automations. Gantt and calendar views with eye catching and flexible features make visualizing projects and jobs-to-be done easy and attractive. It's minor, but having word processing options within make it really easy to set up a workspace that contains both list/chart views and note/long-form text views in one space. Many ways to work to fit any team or team members preferences, all easily integrated in one space. Admin team and user management is also very intuitive.
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What do you dislike about monday Work Management?
There's nothing to straight out dislike, but in terms of suggestions, it would ben nice if a gantt chart or calendar view could be built first and have the board prepopulate rather than other way around. Additional flexibility in those features would help as well (ways of viewing, zooming in/out etc.). The way folders work could be improved as well to help with board/file management - for example, right now if you move an item from one folder to another you expand all folders at once and have to re-collapse them all - little things like that.

"Intuitive Tool for Project Management"
5/5
What do you like best about monday Work Management?
I absolutely love using monday Work Management as it is incredibly intuitive, making it easy for me to navigate and utilize effectively in my role as the Business Manager of a private school. The platform seamlessly integrates with other tools, particularly beneficial as we work extensively with the Google Suite, allowing us to attach all related documentation to each item in the platform with ease. The ready-to-use templates are a significant asset, thoughtfully designed to meet our needs and significantly reduce the time required to set up new boards for tracking student enrollment and various projects. Moreover, the ease of initial setup was simply remarkable, reinforcing the platform's user-friendly nature and efficiency.

"Highly Customizable, But Needs Better Notifications"
4.5/5
What do you like best about monday Work Management?
I like the ability to customize every board depending on the projects and on the needs. This customization makes it highly adaptable to various project requirements, enhancing my team’s efficiency. I also appreciate that it offers different types of views, which make it easier for everyone to focus on the aspects most relevant to their roles. Moreover, I like the feature that allows us to leave comments and updates, which keeps everyone aware of what's going on. This transparency and communication help streamline project management and ensure that no important details are missed.
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What do you dislike about monday Work Management?
I think it would be better if monday Work Management had a more robust system for notifications. The current notification system can be quite weak, especially when connecting with Microsoft Teams. There are times it glitches, and as a result, notifications aren't sent, which means some updates can get lost.

"Effective CRM and Task Management, Needs Better Onboarding"
4/5
What do you like best about monday Work Management?
I like the way monday Work Management keeps our CRM database very unique and understandable, which is crucial for keeping every team member on the same page. This ensures that we all stay informed and collaborate effectively. As part of the business development team, this clarity helps us keep track, systemize our countries, and manage our lead sources efficiently, especially since we are scouting fashion brands from all over the world. This organized approach streamlines our workflow and helps maintain consistency across our global operations.
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What do you dislike about monday Work Management?
I feel that 'monday Work Management' can be difficult to understand and utilize to its full potential. This is mainly due to the challenge our team faces in comprehending the solution and features entirely. Although I appreciate the availability of webinars, more guidance would be helpful. Additionally, the initial setup was slightly challenging because our team consists of remote members across Europe, leading to difficulties in systemizing everyone on the same basis even though it wasn't directly a work management issue.

"An intuitive and flexible platform to keep all projects on track"
4.5/5
What do you like best about monday Work Management?
What I like most about monday.com is how visual and easy to use it is.

I use it daily to organize projects, track progress, and collaborate with teammates.

The boards, timelines, and automations make it very clear who’s doing what and when, it keeps everyone aligned without endless emails or meetings.


I really appreciate how simple it is to customize workflows: you can adapt the platform to any process, from task tracking to marketing campaigns or team planning.

Integrations with tools like Slack, Google Drive, and Outlook make it fit perfectly into our daily workflow.

It’s a tool that truly helps boost productivity and team transparency.
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What do you dislike about monday Work Management?
Not much.

The mobile app could be a bit smoother when managing complex boards, and reporting could use more customization.

But overall, the experience is extremely positive, the usability and flexibility easily outweigh these small limitations.

"Streamlined Task Management with Room for AI Improvement"
5/5
What do you like best about monday Work Management?
I like the flexibility of monday Work Management and the ability to adapt different goals according to a wide range of topics. This flexibility allows us to create boards tailored for various divisions, including one sitting abroad, alongside internal boards and those dedicated to specific tasks. This adaptability is crucial for us as it accommodates the diverse topics we deal with in our company. It’s actually quite a great feature, making the tool very practical and effective for task management across different business types.
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What do you dislike about monday Work Management?
I find the limited use and implementation of the AI functions in monday Work Management notable. It seems that there is much room for improvement in effectively leveraging AI to create and manage tasks more efficiently. Additionally, the adaptation period requires a shift in how people approach task management, moving away from double tasking with other tools like Excel and emails. This change requires time for users to fully transition to using monday Work Management as the primary tool.

"Intuitive, Customisable Layout Makes Organising My Work Simple"
5/5
What do you like best about monday Work Management?
The visual layout allows me to quickly see where everything stands at a glance for me and my team. I also appreciate that it is sortable, customisable, and very easy to use so onboarding new staff is uncomplicated for the basic features. I use monday every single day to keep track of projects, tasks and my team.
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What do you dislike about monday Work Management?
The only issue I have is that I’m required to use the same status categories in a column within a board. There are times when I want to track the same information within a single board, but the categories just aren’t relevant for all groups. This means I end up having to add unnecessary columns or even create additional boards to accommodate the differences.

5/5
What do you like best about monday Work Management?
The vast array of tools/features and integrations that allow the different teams across the business to collaborate on projects together without miscommunication or confusion. Monday is intuitive, making it both easy to use and easy to implement across multiple teams of people.


We use it every day to track micro and macro metrics across the business, and if we ever have had an issue, the customer service has been sterling.
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What do you dislike about monday Work Management?
The only minor irritant when it comes to Monday.com is the navigation between workspaces, which fortunately isn't necessary alot of the time, as it can feel clunky to move to a workspace thqat is alternate to the main, or default workspace.



"A single platform that unifies work, reduces friction, and boosts team clarity"
5/5
What do you like best about ClickUp?
What I like most is how much I can centralise in a single place: tasks, documents, discussions, deadlines and dashboards for different projects and teams. The hierarchy (Workspaces → Spaces → Folders → Lists → Tasks), custom fields and views (List, Board, Gantt, etc.) let me adapt ClickUp to very different workflows without needing separate tools. It’s also great for collaborative work: comments, assigned comments, checklists and automations make it much easier to follow who is doing what and keep complex projects under control.
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What do you dislike about ClickUp?
Sometimes the flexibility comes with complexity: new users can feel overwhelmed by the number of options and configuration screens. These aren’t deal-breakers, but they are areas where there is still room for improvement.

What do you like best about ClickUp?
What I love most about ClickUp is how seamlessly everything works together. The combination of Chat, Whiteboards, and Spaces allows us to brainstorm, assign, and track work all in one place. It’s flexible, visual, and highly customizable perfect for managing multiple teams and projects across departments. The Wiki feature also helped us replace scattered SOPs and onboarding docs with a single source of truth.
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What do you dislike about ClickUp?
The learning curve can be steep for new users, especially when trying to navigate the depth of features without guidance. Some team members found it overwhelming at first. Also, while the mobile app is useful, it’s not yet as fluid or complete as the desktop version. A few UI refinements could improve speed and intuitiveness overall.

"Clickup is what Jira had to do, but didn't"
3/5
What do you like best about ClickUp?
The new UI doesn't look that bad. Even when it's a "Notion-like" UI, it works a little faster, and it has implemented new features that are pretty cool, like AI, or docs, or whiteboards... Everything in a single place is pretty useful.
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What do you dislike about ClickUp?
It's still noisy as hell, too many apps, too many places, too many features, so it's now a Slack, Docs, Jira, Trello, Monday, Idontknowwhatelse, and it feels too much, when we just want to handle some simple projects, it feels like we are going in a labyrinth of buttons and clicks...


I think Clickup should have a ramp-up wizard at the beggining with nearly nothing in the UI, then the user shuld be able to enable/disable stuff, so it starts simple but if you need something like "Chat", go enable it, "oh so you need a knowledge base, ok enable it" stuff like that but not everything at once, or we will get crazy.....


Honestly, I think I would switch to 4 instead of 6, but what I decided to go up is because in the enterprise grade, this could be a more complete tool and don't have to jump between multiple apps... (it could be "multiple apps" inside the same one, and not literally different UIs/pages, so that would make it easier, like for example what Atlassian is doing, that Jira, Confluence, Goals and others are different apps but inside the same place with almost the same UI, so it feels better that way)

"Boosted productivity with Brain MAX"
5/5
What do you like best about ClickUp?
The new Brain MAX has greatly enhanced my productivity. The ability to use multiple AI models, including advanced reasoning models, for an affordable price makes it easy to centralize everything in one platform. Features like voice-to-text, task automation, and integration with other apps make the workflow much smoother and smarter.
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What do you dislike about ClickUp?
Despite the improvements, performance can be a bit heavy on older computers, especially when using multiple automations and AI features simultaneously. Also, the initial learning curve can be a bit challenging for new users.

"One Workspace to Rule My Tasks -- With a Bit of Setup Upfront."
5/5
What do you like best about ClickUp?
For someone working solo/small team (like me Android/Kotlin Solo Traveler project scope), the free/mid-tier capabilities feel generous -- I could start without big cost and grow as needed. The major win for me is how ClickUp lets me see everything in one place, Tasks, Docs, Goals, Calendar, Boards -- so i rarely feel like I'm "jumping between apps". And the integrations with tools I already use reduced friction in our dev + blogging + team communications workflow.
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What do you dislike about ClickUp?
Sometimes the UI feels busty: with so many options, buttons and views, many nested project or hefty automations -- on slower hardware/browser I noticed a bit of lag.

"Highly recommend Brain MAX for anyone serious about boosting productivity and clarity!"
4/5
What do you like best about ClickUp?
ClickUp Brain MAX has been an incredible addition to my workflow. The way it combines multiple LLMs in one platform makes responses faster and more reliable, and the speech-to-text across the platform is a huge time-saver. I also really appreciate the enterprise-grade security, which gives peace of mind when handling sensitive information.


What stands out most is how it helps me cut through the noise and think clearer — whether I’m summarizing meetings, drafting content, or brainstorming new ideas. It feels like having an all-in-one AI assistant that adapts to whatever I need.
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What do you dislike about ClickUp?
Because ClickUp is packed with features, customization options, and different views (lists, boards, Gantt, etc.), it can be overwhelming at first. New users often need considerable time to become comfortable and productive.

"ClickUp: Revolutionized Our Task Management"
5/5
What do you like best about ClickUp?
I love the ease of use of ClickUp, especially in creating and customizing tasks, as I can adapt them exactly to my needs. The ability to integrate apps, organize in lists, set priorities, create columns, and fully customize tasks allows me to have a unique management experience. Furthermore, ClickUp efficiently solves task management, deadlines, and priority issues, which simplifies my life, both personal and professional. The integration with other tools, such as time apps and Google tools, also enhances my productivity and simplifies my routine. The transition to ClickUp from Trello and Google Tasks made my life much easier, as it centralizes everything on a single platform, from task management to document and spreadsheet organization. The initial setup process was facilitated by resources like YouTube videos and the official blog, but the support I received when I migrated to the paid plan was incredible, offering video conferences and tips, which further improved my usability on the platform. This effective support and the continuous development of new features that meet my needs, even those I wasn't always aware of, make ClickUp an indisputable choice.

"ClickUp: A Robust Project Management Tool That Grows with You"
5/5
What do you like best about ClickUp?
ClickUp excels in its versatility and all-in-one approach to project management. It's became our organization's most frequently used app. It brings together task management, document creation, time tracking, goals, and collaboration tools in one unified interface which provides ease of implementation. The customization options are a standout, from custom views and statuses to automation and dashboards. It’s highly scalable, making it suitable for individuals, small teams, and large organizations alike. The interface is sleek, and features like recurring tasks, integrations with different tools , and the “Everything” view really streamline workflow management.

Customer support is generally responsive and helpful. The live chat and help center offer solid assistance, especially during the onboarding phase. However, response times can vary, and deeper technical issues may take longer to resolve. The ClickUp community and documentation are strong secondary resources when direct support is delayed.
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What do you dislike about ClickUp?
ClickUp chat features are good but lags message delivery. Performance can sometimes lag when managing large workspaces or switching between views.

Additionally, while the mobile app is improving, it still lacks some of the responsiveness and ease of use found on the desktop version.

Occasionally, bugs or inconsistencies in updates can affect productivity.

The best thing about ClickUp is its incredible flexibility and customizability. You can really tailor it to fit any workflow or project management style.

5/5
What do you like best about ClickUp?
It's intuitive, easy and fast to do what I need to do. I think it truly lives up to it's promise of minimizing clicks! I don't ever feel frustrated with the tool or think "why can't I just do xyz?" I like that I am able to report on time tracked and to view my tasks by due date, so that with multiple clients (and my own personal stuff) I am able to view only what I need to for that day. I literally could not do my job or keep track of any of my own stuff without this tool. And it's SO affordable!
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What do you dislike about ClickUp?
I don't like that a couple of timetracking features I have always used (time tags and time notes) were recently turned into Business features. So now, even though I'm already on a paid plan and I'm just a single-user instance, I now have to pay for the Business Plan just to get those two features, and I feel like I'm paying for a lot of other stuff I won't ever need now.

"Spreadsheet Ease Meets App-builder freedom - Perfect Blend, Some Trade-Offs"
5/5
What do you like best about Airtable?
I really appreciate how Airtable makes it easy to build something more than a vanilla spreadsheet: linking tables, choosing field types (attachments, dropdowns, checkboxes), and then visualising the data in grids, calendars, Kanban boards - it gives me flexibility without jumping into full database dev. The fact that I didn't need to code to start is a big plus: within hours I had prototypes running, collating blog ideas, app features, marketing tasks - which for a solo dev/blogger workflow matters a lot.
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What do you dislike about Airtable?
While the "views" and flexibility are strong, setting up a well-structured, maintainable base takes though: if you don't define conventions early (naming fields, designing relationships, orchestrating automations), the base can become messy and harder to manage.

I have been using Airtable for more than 3 years now and this is one of the most advanced spreadsheet that I have ever used.

What do you dislike about Airtable?
As learning each and every feature of Google sheet and MS Excel was already a difficult task earlier and the struggle is same with airtable and mostly for new users because learning it's all the usability is slow and time taking process. You will need a proper training session of more than 45 days to learn each and every feature and work perfectly by taking its optimum benefits.

4/5
What do you like best about Airtable?
1. I like the fact that Airtable can be used as the central foundation for storing data coming in from different sources and manage them in different tables.

2. Second most loved feature is the ability to switch between multiple data views as Gantt Charts, Kanban or Grid.

3. It is user friendly to use

4. It offers great integration libraries to establish a one-way or 2-way sync between different software systems.
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What do you dislike about Airtable?
1. Pricing is a bit overwhelming.Free and lower plans have imposed limits on storign the multi media files that can be a bottleneck.

2. Airtable is totally cloud based solution which might lead to high infrastructure cost and sometimes limit the data accessibility in offline situations as they don't offer any off-cloud services.

There are no rigid templates but it can be created with just the AI tool which makes this platform very powerful and robust. The Capacity to integrate its platform is a big help while using this platform. I love the easy to login feature and user friendly Interface. The Automation feature of this platform is astounding. It will make user very effective with some learning. The pipelining is so good that there is hardly any chance that any project deadline will be missed.

What do you dislike about Airtable?
I am satisfied with its robust feature but to very effective and efficient in using this software, one must do a lot of learning. I feel that the platform is little bit slow while implementing on my browser but it is manageable. I also wish that the cost of the Platform is a little lower that the current pricing.

"Airtable Makes Data Management Effortless and Secure"
4.5/5
What do you like best about Airtable?
irtable is such a systematic tool — it offers amazing ways to organize and manage data. I’ve been using it for a year now, and I’m completely used to it. Unlike Google Sheets or Excel, there’s almost less risk of anyone messing up the data.
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What do you dislike about Airtable?
The only thing I don’t like is that it doesn’t show who made the last changes. Or maybe I just haven’t found that option on my dashboard yet.

What do you like best about Airtable?
AirTable can do as much or as little as you'd like. It can be a glorified Excel document or it can be a full project management system with automation and user interfaces.
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What do you dislike about Airtable?
When you start to get into the more complex uses of AirTable and have multiple users, training and a general understanding is required. We also have to be weary of how people are using it, because someone could add something that breaks something else.

"A Single Source of Truth"
5/5
What do you like best about Wrike?
We implemented Wrike in our creative agency over three years ago, and it has transformed the way we manage work. What started as a tool to streamline project intake quickly became the backbone of our operations. Wrike allows us to centralize requests, track projects from start to finish, and create greater visibility across teams through dashboards and reporting.
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What do you dislike about Wrike?
My only complaint is that I have failed to see new features and tools released as requested by the community. There are huge threads of customers asking to see certain features implemented, and the Wrike team always assures us they're being worked on. I recently searched for a solution and discovered that someone had asked for the same feature to be built once monthly since 2017.

"Streamlines Team Management with Useful Workload Features"
3.5/5
What do you like best about Wrike?
I find the workload and effort features in Wrike immensely useful for managing projects within our marketing agency. As a creative team member, these features help our project management team understand when people are overloaded and identify who can handle additional responsibilities. This significantly assists in organizing teams, scheduling work, and managing workloads efficiently across the agency. Having used Wrike for nearly 20 years, we have integrated these and more features deeply into our working methods, which enhances our overall productivity and organization.
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What do you dislike about Wrike?
I think one of the biggest issues I face with Wrike is the absence of workload views on an iPad. I use the iPad sometimes as a secondary platform to view Wrike when I'm working, and it's not very easy to do so without the workload view.

"Uncluttered dashboard makes it easy to use once you get used to the layout"
4.5/5
What do you like best about Wrike?
Wrike has an uncluttered dashboard that allows us to see pending tasks and who needs to handle specific task. It is easy to move or reorder tasks to suit our workflow. I also appreciate their sales people who were ready to help when we switched to Wrike.
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What do you dislike about Wrike?
Key features are hidden behind small icons and dropdown menus such that you have to click around before you get used to the dashboard. when assigning tasks or adding due date beginners might struggle to find the tiny dropdown buttons. I also missed notifications becauss they don't really grab attention. I always had to doublecheck if someone left a message or comment.

"Boosts Team Collaboration, Smart Integrations"
4.5/5
What do you like best about Wrike?
I appreciate how Wrike empowers my team to collaborate efficiently, allowing us to deliver projects faster. What I like most about Wrike is its ability to boost productivity and reduce manual work significantly once one understands its full potential. The integration with Outlook and MS Teams is a standout feature, saving us hours every day by keeping everything centralized. I can effortlessly turn emails or chats into tasks instantly, helping me stay on top of projects without the hassle of constantly switching between applications. Additionally, Wrike's AI feature was a crucial reason for our switch from Teamwork, showcasing its ability to innovate and stay ahead. The competitive pricing and outstanding support team further add to the experience, making Wrike a compelling choice for our project management needs.
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What do you dislike about Wrike?
I find the mobile app to have limitations compared to the desktop version. It's useful for quick updates but is less intuitive and lacks some functionalities.

"Customizable Workflows and Support Make Wrike Feel Like Our Own"
4.5/5
What do you like best about Wrike?
I appreciate Wrike because it allows us to customize our workflow and adjust it over time to create the ideal platform. Over time it feels like it we designed it ourselves. The customer care team was helpful when we were starting out.
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What do you dislike about Wrike?
I feel it is not for people who are new to project management tools. It might feel overwhelming if you join an ongoing project setup by others. It will take time to learn and get used. I also feel all the team members have the power to mess the workflow.

Wrike’s standout feature is its versatile views, resembling a spreadsheet but with the advantage of being online. It simplifies project management and makes progress tracking effortless.

It’s user-friendly, and the online support team is consistently helpful and reliable.

"A great tool for management and organization across all project sizes"
5/5
What do you like best about Wrike?
What I like the most about Write is the high level of customization it offers for each project. You can easily set the level of communication and collaboration with co-workers or team members, which makes it adaptable for small, medium, and large projects. The user interface is smooth, clear, and very intuitive. It’s also easy to use, and customer support is responsive and helpful. I especially value the built-in features like project risk tracking, Gantt charts that automatically update tasks, and the ability to assign specific tasks to the right people. The recent addition of AI capabilities makes the tool even more powerful and forward-looking.
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What do you dislike about Wrike?
Because there are so many features and options available, it can feel overwhelming at first. For new users, a simpler starting view or setup could make the onboarding process easier. Once you get familiar with the platform, however, it becomes much easier to navigate and take advantage of all the features.

"A great tool to organize your Tasks and Projects every day"
5/5
What do you like best about Wrike?
Wrike has been a key tool in organizing my individual work and coordinating with my team. I use it in my daily routine, and it has become a fundamental part of my work routine. What I highlight the most is its intuitive interface, which allows for quick adaptation without the need for an extensive learning curve. From the first use, managing tasks, projects, and assignments becomes very smooth.

A great advantage is how easy it was to implement it within our team. There was no need for a long or complex process; in no time, we were all working in an orderly and efficient manner. Additionally, the personalized support that Wrike offers has been excellent: every time I have had a question or requirement, the attention has been quick, clear, and very friendly, which generates a lot of trust.

I love that each task can have its own description, assigned responsibilities, start and end dates, customized tags, and attached files. This greatly facilitates detailed tracking of work, especially when it comes to projects with multiple members or various stages.

One of the most useful features is the dashboard that allows you to see the status of all tasks: in progress, pending, completed, or canceled. This level of visibility helps me prioritize better and anticipate possible bottlenecks.

Moreover, the automatic notifications and integration with other platforms (such as email, Google Drive, or Slack) ensure that the entire workflow is always synchronized. In summary, Wrike is a very complete, agile, and reliable tool for maintaining organization and efficiency both on a personal and team level.
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What do you dislike about Wrike?
Although in general I find Wrike to be an excellent tool, there are some details that could be improved to make the experience even smoother. One of the aspects that complicates things for me the most is when I change a task's status within the workflow. Sometimes, after dragging a task to a new column (for example, from "In Progress" to "Completed"), I can't immediately see it in its new status. This creates some uncertainty, as it makes me doubt whether the change was really saved or if the task ended up in the right place.

On several occasions, I have had to perform manual searches or review multiple filters to find the task again and verify that the change was applied. Although it doesn't happen all the time, when it does, it can waste time, especially when working with many tasks simultaneously or with large projects.

I believe that an improvement in the immediate visualization of the status change, or some type of clearer and more visible confirmation, would make a big difference. It would also be useful to have a more accessible history of the last modified tasks to facilitate tracking. Wrike is very powerful, but small adjustments like this could further enhance the user experience.
